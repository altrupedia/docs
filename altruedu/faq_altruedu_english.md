**What is altruedu?**

Are you under 18 years old and a student? Then here's the good news: at altruedu, we think first and foremost about YOU and YOUR needs. Unlike other platforms, altruedu is not a watered-down "children's version" of the "real" adult version. At altruedu, everything starts with young people - with YOU! YOU are the future of our world and YOU are worth thinking about first. That's why YOU are the starting point for everything we develop. Together, we want to create a network that is tailored to YOU. At altruedu, your strengths are in demand and your weaknesses are welcome. Here you will find like-minded people with whom you can network. Whether for tutoring or hobbies. Here you will find a community of altruedus where people support each other and help each other with school and life issues.

**Who is altruedu for?**

In general, anyone under the age of 18 is welcome at altruedu.
However, if you are not sure whether altruedu is the right platform for you, the following questions may help you:
-	I am looking for tutoring / team members for competitions such as "Jugend forscht" / experts who can support me in my interests / a mentor from science or business / ...?
-	I am looking for meaningful tasks that I can do alongside school.
-	I would like to network with like-minded people.
-	I want to share my knowledge and skills with others.
-	I am willing to help others and receive support from other altruedus in return.
-	I would like to take on small tasks in the development of altruedu.

Can you answer "yes" to some of the questions? Then altruedu is the right place for YOU. :)

**I like the idea of altruedu, but unfortunately I don't have the energy at the moment to contribute anything myself. Is altruedu also for me?**

Of course it is. Don't worry, it's completely okay if you just take for now. You can still give later. For now, your goal should be to develop yourself so that you have the desire and energy to contribute to something like altruedu. And that's exactly why you'll get the support you need from us altruedus. Unconditionally.

**Who's behind altruedu?**

That's us - Stephan and Katharina.

Stephan is the founder and inventor of the *Altruversum*. He is the creative mind and the technical brain behind the platform. Stephan studied physics in Heidelberg. After graduating, he first worked as a backend developer at SAP, but after two years he decided to do a doctorate at CERN. He is now almost at the end of his doctorate and is determined to create a better parallel world with the *Altruversum*.

*Stephan's motto in life: "Life is like windsurfing: No matter from where and how strong the wind blows, you can use it."*

I am Katharina, the creative leisure and the head of altruedu. I'm actually a teacher of physics, German and astronomy. Through my profession, I have many insights into the current educational landscape and know first-hand the challenges and concerns of students in 2024. I also work as a guest author at *Spektrum der Wissenschaft* and as a team leader at *ScienceAcademy BW*.

*Katharina's motto in life: Don't judge!...and no more subjunctives.*
