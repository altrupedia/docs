E: Education
- E1: Do you want to carry out L1 for your school? Get in contact with me.

      and the nicest translation will become the foundation stone of the 
      altrupedia official german translation.
      
L: Language
- L1: Translate the cpp/constitution/constitution.h into nice flowfull german.
- L2: Translate constitution.h into every language there is
 
N: No coding skills requiered

- N1: chief of social media (in direct collaboration with me)
- N2: come up with a nice 'not-corporate' timeless web design. I imagine sth similar to wikipedia, surely with a different font and colors but structurewise similar. If you already know how to implement it in js and js frameworks even better, but no need
- N3 the same for the educational branch of altrupedia. Should look somewhat fresher but still merge nicely with the design of other altrupedia domains.
-  

**Note: I don't care about any qualifications or grad records or whatever. In Altrupedia, the only thing that counts is your will.**
