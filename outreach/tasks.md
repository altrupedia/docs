Tasks

C: Technical
- C1: write an application, that shows current screenshots of all altrupedia email accounts and post boxes. In collaboration with altrupedias front end architect (not me). 
- C2: Develop a test framework for all altrupedia code

N: No coding skills requiered

- N1: chief of social media (in direct collaboration with me)
- N2: come up with a nice 'not-corporate' timeless web design. I imagine sth similar to wikipedia, surely with a different font and colors but structurewise similar. If you already know how to implement it in js and js frameworks even better, but no need
- N3 the same for the educational branch of altrupedia. Should look somewhat fresher but still merge nicely with the design of other altrupedia domains.
-  

**Note: I don't care about any qualifications or grad records or whatever. In Altrupedia, the only thing that counts is your will.**
