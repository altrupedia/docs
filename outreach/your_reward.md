# Your Reward

Maybe some of you ask yourself: Why should I invest my time?

One **possible** outcome scenario:
- altrupedia will become as widely known and used as Wikipedia. 
Wouldnt it be nice, if you contributed from the very beginning? 
Wouldn't it be nice, if your design/algorithms, will once be as commonly known as... you name it. 
And all of that, without 
- without any ads 
- without any bad influences from bad people
- without annoying cookie banners, trans-site tracking, etc. for data vultures 
- without any money involved, 
- without any rich bastard getting richer
- publicly accesible
- built by people who didnt do it for money, but for something else


**What I promise:
Whatever you bring in, you will get it back. Contributing will give you the possibility to** 
- work and learn from true experts in their fields.**
- experience from within, how big projects can grow in an organized, atomic manner
- become proficient with git and GitHub. The standard tool used in industry and science for all sorts of information handling where you want 100% transparancy, traceability and reproducability (thats how good science is done)
- become proficient with actually anything you want

**All of that, no matter your prior journey through the universe.**


# Lets demonstrate to corporate, governments and other global players, what we can do better. And I bet, there is a lot.
