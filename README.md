Hello,
Im glad you found this file. For now, this README serves as main point of entry for all information regarding altrupedia.space .

I have a vision for a better future, built on the shoulders of \strikethrough{giants} Y O U .

I'm aware that up to now I have shared (almost) nothing but a little additional entropy, bringing our universe closer to the point in time and space, when time will have given up on its directedness.

At the moment, I'm still waiting for some laywer stuff. But the moment my vision has been somewhat engraved into earthly matter in terms of Ink & 1's and 0's, you will learn my concrete idea. That is, you will have the possiblity to learn.

Until then, all Im gonna share with you is an ordered stack of tasks that need to be done before my vision can become reality.

If this sounds like wou wanna be part of it, you can easily choose a task you would like to do and start working on it. With the help of all of U S .

Until then,
Stephan 

ps: new content will appear regularly, here, from now on.
